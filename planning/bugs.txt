When cards snap back when choosing a crib, sometimes they snap back behind other cards, and even behind the crib boundary
When the player has put 2 cards in the crib, then picks up one of the crib cards it always snaps back to the hand, even if it's dropped back down inside the crib boundary
The crib doesn't poll for the other player putting their cards in, and for the player who first puts the cards in the state never changes.
